# Push Notification Infrastructure Implementation

## Description
Implement push notification support for the Bubble Timer backend using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to provide seamless integration with the existing AWS ecosystem. This will enable push notifications for timer invitations, completions, and other important events without requiring external services like Firebase.

## Status
- [x] Not Started
- [x] In Progress
- [ ] Blocked
- [ ] Completed

## Background
The current Bubble Timer app has a task for implementing push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), but the backend is built entirely on AWS services. Adding Amazon SNS for push notifications provides better integration with the existing infrastructure and eliminates the need for external dependencies.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: AWS SNS Infrastructure Setup (CDK-Driven) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Updated CDK Stack** (`bubble-timer-backend-stack.ts`)
  - ✅ Added SNS Topic for timer sharing notifications
  - ✅ Created IAM roles and policies for SNS publishing
  - ✅ Added environment variables for SNS configuration
  - ✅ Added `device_tokens` DynamoDB table with proper indexes
  - ✅ Created setup guide for manual Platform Application creation
- **Platform Application Setup** (Manual - see `docs/SNS_PLATFORM_APPLICATION_SETUP.md`)
  - ✅ Documentation for creating SNS Platform Application via AWS CLI/Console
  - ✅ FCM server key storage in AWS Parameter Store
  - ✅ Environment-specific setup for beta/prod
  - ✅ Platform Application ARNs configured for both environments

- **Device Token Management**
  - ✅ Created Lambda functions for token registration/cleanup

  - [ ] **Token Refresh**: Handle FCM token refresh and re-register with backend
  - [ ] **App Uninstall**: No cleanup needed (tokens become invalid automatically)
  - [ ] **User Logout**: Remove device token from backend
  - [ ] **Device ID**: Use existing `Secure.ANDROID_ID` for device identification

### Phase 4: Timer Sharing Workflow

  - [ ] Maintain existing real-time sync for accepted timers

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Observability
- **CloudWatch Metrics**
  - [ ] Notification delivery success/failure rates
  - [ ] Token registration and cleanup metrics
  - [ ] User engagement with notifications
  - [ ] SNS delivery status tracking

- **Logging and Error Tracking**
  - [ ] Structured logs for notification events
  - [ ] Error tracking for failed deliveries
  - [ ] User preference change tracking
  - [ ] Notification delivery latency monitoring

- **Alerting**
  - [ ] High failure rate alerts for notification delivery
  - [ ] Token registration failure alerts

## Core Requirements

### Push Notification Strategy
- **Primary Use Case**: Timer sharing invitations only
- **WebSocket Strategy**: Keep WebSocket disconnected by default, only connect when user accepts shared timer
- **Real-time Sync**: Once timer is accepted, use existing WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Timer Completion**: Device handles timer completion natively, no push notification needed
- **Offline Support**: Push notifications ensure users receive sharing invitations even when offline

### Notification Flow
1. User A shares timer with User B
2. Backend sends push notification to User B (offline/online)
3. User B receives invitation notification with Accept/Decline actions
4. If User B accepts → WebSocket connects → Real-time sync begins
5. If User B declines → No further notifications, timer remains unshared

## Technical Architecture

### AWS Services Used
- **Amazon SNS**: Push notification delivery
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Android notification transport
- **DynamoDB**: Device token storage and notification preferences
- **Lambda**: Notification processing and delivery
- **Cognito**: User authentication and device association

### Database Schema Extensions

**Device Tokens Table**
```
Partition Key: user_id (String)
Sort Key: device_id (String)
Attributes:
- fcm_token (String) - Firebase Cloud Messaging token
- platform (String) - "android" (future: "ios")
- created_at (String) - Token registration timestamp
- last_used (String) - Last successful notification timestamp
- notification_preferences (Map) - User notification settings
```

**Notification Preferences**
```json
{
  "timer_invitations": true,
  "quiet_hours_start": "22:00",
  "quiet_hours_end": "08:00"
}
```

### Notification Service API

```typescript
interface NotificationService {
  // Send timer sharing invitation notification
  sendSharingInvitation(
    targetUserId: string, 
    timerId: string, 
    sharerName: string, 
    timerName: string
  ): Promise<void>;
  
  // Register device token for user
  registerDeviceToken(userId: string, deviceId: string, fcmToken: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Remove device token
  removeDeviceToken(userId: string, deviceId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Update notification preferences
  updatePreferences(userId: string, preferences: NotificationPreferences): Promise<void>;
}

interface NotificationPayload {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  data: {
    timerId: string;
    action: 'accept' | 'decline';
    sharerName: string;
    timerName: string;
  };
  priority: 'high';
  sound: true;
  vibration: true;
}
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### WebSocket Strategy
- **Default State**: WebSocket disconnected to conserve resources
- **Connection Trigger**: Only connect when user accepts shared timer invitation
- **Real-time Sync**: Use existing WebSocket for timer updates after acceptance
- **Disconnection**: Disconnect when no shared timers are active

### Timer Sharing Workflow (Updated)
1. User A calls `POST /timers/shared` with `{ "timerId": "timer123", "userIds": ["userB", "userC"] }`
2. Backend validates permissions and creates shared timer records for each target user
3. Backend sends push notification to each invitee's devices
4. Each invitee receives invitation notification with Accept/Decline actions
5. If invitee accepts → WebSocket connects → Real-time sync begins
6. If invitee declines → Timer remains unshared for that user, no WebSocket connection

### API Endpoints
- `POST /timers/shared` - Share timer with users (synchronous)
  - Body: `{ "timerId": "string", "userIds": ["user1", "user2"] }`
- `DELETE /timers/shared` - Decline shared timer invitation (existing)
  - Body: `{ "timerId": "string" }`
- `POST /device-tokens` - Register FCM token for user
  - Body: `{ "deviceId": "string", "fcmToken": "string" }`
- `DELETE /device-tokens/{deviceId}` - Remove FCM token

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Direct
- **Pros**: Industry standard, extensive documentation
- **Cons**: Requires external service, additional complexity
- **Decision**: Not chosen due to AWS ecosystem preference

### Amazon Pinpoint
- **Pros**: Advanced analytics, user segmentation
- **Cons**: Overkill for simple push notifications, higher cost
- **Decision**: SNS provides sufficient functionality at lower cost

### WebSocket-Only Notifications
- **Pros**: Real-time, no additional services
- **Cons**: No offline support, unreliable delivery
- **Decision**: Push notifications provide better reliability and offline support

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- `NotificationService` methods and error handling
- Device token management and cleanup
- Notification preference validation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end notification delivery
- Token registration and cleanup workflows
- Notification preference updates

### Manual Testing
- Push notification delivery on various Android versions
- Offline notification behavior

## Security Considerations

### Token Security
- **Client-side Encryption**: Encrypt FCM tokens before storing in DynamoDB
- **AWS KMS Integration**: Use AWS KMS for encryption key management
- **Token Validation**: Validate token ownership before sending notifications
- **Token Rotation**: Implement automatic token refresh and cleanup
- **Best Practices**: Follow AWS SNS security guidelines for server-side encryption

### User Privacy
- Respect notification preferences
- Implement quiet hours functionality
- Allow users to opt out of specific notification types

### Rate Limiting
- Implement notification rate limiting per user
- Prevent notification spam
- Monitor and alert on unusual notification patterns

## Performance Considerations

### SNS Optimization
- Batch notifications when possible
- Use SNS message attributes for filtering
- Implement retry logic for failed deliveries

### DynamoDB Optimization
- Use efficient queries for device token lookups
- Implement TTL for stale tokens
- Optimize notification preference queries
