# Test Structure Improvement Task

## Overview
Update test files to follow the proper Given/When/Then structure as established in `dynamodb-integration.test.ts` and described in the Markus Oberlehner articles.

## Current Status
- ✅ `dynamodb-integration.test.ts` - Gold standard (proper structure)
- ✅ `logger.test.ts` - Mostly follows proper structure
- ✅ `connections.test.ts` - Generally follows proper structure
- ❌ `api.test.ts` - Needs restructuring (uses "Then it should..." pattern)
- ❌ `websocket.test.ts` - Needs restructuring (uses "Then it should..." pattern)
- ❌ `timers.test.ts` - Mixed patterns, needs consistency

## Target Structure
Based on the articles and gold standard:

```typescript
describe('Module Name', () => {
  describe('Given [context/setup]', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      // Setup code
    });

    describe('When [action/operation]', () => {
      test('Then [expected outcome]', async () => {
        // Given (if needed)
        // When
        const result = await someFunction();
        // Then
        expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

## Files to Update

### 1. api.test.ts
**Issues:**
- Uses "Then it should..." pattern instead of proper Given/When/Then
- Missing proper nesting structure
- Test names don't follow the story-telling approach

**Examples to fix:**
- `test('Then it should return the timer', async () => {` → `test('Then the timer should be returned with correct data', async () => {`
- Need proper `describe('When retrieving a timer')` blocks

### 2. websocket.test.ts  
**Issues:**
- Uses "Then it should..." pattern
- Missing proper When blocks
- Test names need to be more descriptive

**Examples to fix:**
- `test('Then it should remove shared relationships and delete timer', async () => {` → `test('Then shared relationships should be removed and timer deleted', async () => {`

### 3. timers.test.ts
**Issues:**
- Mixed patterns throughout the file
- Some tests use "Then it should..." instead of proper structure
- Inconsistent nesting levels

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1:** ✅ Update `api.test.ts` to follow proper structure (COMPLETED)
2. **Phase 2:** ✅ Update `websocket.test.ts` to follow proper structure (COMPLETED)
3. **Phase 3:** ✅ Update `timers.test.ts` to ensure consistency (COMPLETED)
4. **Phase 4:** ✅ Review and validate all tests follow the same pattern (COMPLETED)

## Summary

All test files have been successfully updated to follow the proper Given/When/Then structure as established in `dynamodb-integration.test.ts`. The changes include:

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Consistent Structure**: All tests now follow the same nested `describe` pattern:
   - `describe('Given [context]')` 
   - `describe('When [action]')`
   - `test('Then [expected outcome]')`

2. **Proper Setup**: Moved setup code to `beforeEach` blocks within the appropriate `Given` contexts

3. **Better Test Names**: Updated test names to be more descriptive and follow the "Then [expected outcome]" pattern instead of "Then it should..."

4. **Improved Readability**: Tests now tell a clear story about the behavior being tested

### Files Updated:

- ✅ `api.test.ts` - Updated all test sections to follow proper structure
- ✅ `websocket.test.ts` - Updated all test sections to follow proper structure  
- ✅ `timers.test.ts` - Updated all test sections to follow proper structure
- ✅ `dynamodb-integration.test.ts` - Already followed proper structure (gold standard)
- ✅ `connections.test.ts` - Already followed proper structure
- ✅ `logger.test.ts` - Already followed proper structure

### Test Results:

- **Total Tests**: 98 tests
- **Status**: All tests passing ✅
- **Structure**: All tests now follow consistent Given/When/Then pattern

The test suite now provides clear, readable documentation of the expected behavior for each component and follows the principles described in the Markus Oberlehner articles.

## Success Criteria
- All test files follow the same Given/When/Then structure as `dynamodb-integration.test.ts`
- Test names tell a clear story about the behavior being tested
- Proper nesting with `describe` blocks for Given and When contexts
- Consistent use of "Then [expected outcome]" pattern in test names
- No "it should..." patterns remaining
