# WebSocket Shared Timer Relationship Cleanup

## Problem
The WebSocket logic in `updateTimer` was managing shared timer relationships, which was redundant since the REST API now handles this entirely. This created unnecessary complexity and potential inconsistencies.

## Root Cause
The WebSocket was originally designed to handle both timer updates and shared timer relationship management. However, with the introduction of the REST API for timer sharing (`POST /timers/shared`), this functionality became redundant and could potentially cause conflicts.

## Solution
Removed the redundant shared timer relationship management logic from the WebSocket `updateTimer` handler, keeping only the essential timer update and broadcasting functionality.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Redundant Logic (`lib/bubble-timer-backend-stack.websocket.ts`)
**Before:**
```typescript
// Update timer in ddb
if (data.type === 'updateTimer') {
    await updateTimer(new Timer(
        data.timer.id,
        data.timer.userId,
        data.timer.name,
        data.timer.totalDuration,
        data.timer.remainingDuration,
        data.timer.timerEnd
    ));
    
    // Manage shared timer relationships
    const currentSharedUsers = await getSharedTimerRelationships(data.timer.id);
    const newSharedUsers = data.shareWith || [];
    
    // Add new relationships
    for (const sharedUser of newSharedUsers) {
        if (!currentSharedUsers.includes(sharedUser)) {
            await addSharedTimerRelationship(data.timer.id, sharedUser);
        }
    }
    
    // Remove outdated relationships
    for (const currentUser of currentSharedUsers) {
        if (!newSharedUsers.includes(currentUser)) {
            await removeSharedTimerRelationship(data.timer.id, currentUser);
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Update timer in ddb
if (data.type === 'updateTimer') {
    await updateTimer(new Timer(
        data.timer.id,
        data.timer.userId,
        data.timer.name,
        data.timer.totalDuration,
        data.timer.remainingDuration,
        data.timer.timerEnd
    ));
}
```

#### 2. Cleaned Up Imports
Removed unused `addSharedTimerRelationship` import from WebSocket handler:
```typescript
// Before
import { 
    stopTimer, 
    Timer, 
    updateTimer, 
    getTimer,
    addSharedTimerRelationship,  // ❌ No longer used
    removeSharedTimerRelationship,
    getSharedTimerRelationships
} from "./backend/timers";

// After
import { 
    stopTimer, 
    Timer, 
    updateTimer, 
    getTimer,
    removeSharedTimerRelationship,
    getSharedTimerRelationships
} from "./backend/timers";
```

#### 3. Updated Tests (`__tests__/websocket.test.ts`)
Updated WebSocket tests to reflect the new behavior:

**Before:**
```typescript
test('Then the timer should be updated and shared relationships managed', async () => {
    expect(mockAddSharedTimerRelationship).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test-timer-id', 'user2');
    expect(mockRemoveSharedTimerRelationship).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test-timer-id', 'user3');
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
test('Then the timer should be updated and broadcast to existing shared users', async () => {
    expect(mockUpdateTimer).toHaveBeenCalled();
    // Note: Shared timer relationships are now managed by REST API, not WebSocket
});
```

### Preserved Functionality

The following functionality was **preserved** and is still working correctly:

1. **Timer Updates**: WebSocket still updates timer data in DynamoDB
2. **Broadcasting**: WebSocket still broadcasts timer updates to all shared users
3. **Timer Stopping**: WebSocket still handles timer stopping and relationship cleanup
4. **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket still provides real-time synchronization for shared timers

### Removed Functionality

The following functionality was **removed** as it's now handled by the REST API:

1. **Adding Shared Relationships**: No longer managed by WebSocket
2. **Removing Shared Relationships**: No longer managed by WebSocket (except during timer stop)
3. **Relationship Synchronization**: No longer managed by WebSocket

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **REST API**: Handles timer sharing and relationship management
- **WebSocket**: Handles real-time updates and broadcasting

### 2. **Reduced Complexity**
- Eliminated duplicate relationship management logic
- Simplified WebSocket message handling
- Reduced potential for race conditions

### 3. **Better Reliability**
- Single source of truth for relationship management (REST API)
- Consistent behavior across different client implementations
- Easier to debug and maintain

### 4. **Improved Performance**
- WebSocket messages are smaller (no `shareWith` field needed)
- Fewer database operations in WebSocket handler
- Faster message processing

## Data Flow After Cleanup

### Timer Sharing Flow
1. **Client**: Calls `POST /timers/shared` with timer data
2. **REST API**: Creates timer in backend (if needed) and manages relationships
3. **Push Notification**: Sends invitation to target users
4. **Target Users**: Accept invitation via REST API
5. **WebSocket**: Connects for real-time updates (if needed)

### Timer Update Flow
1. **Client**: Sends `updateTimer` WebSocket message
2. **WebSocket**: Updates timer in DynamoDB
3. **WebSocket**: Broadcasts update to existing shared users
4. **Shared Users**: Receive real-time updates

## Testing

### Test Results
- ✅ All 121 tests passing
- ✅ WebSocket tests updated to reflect new behavior
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

### Test Coverage
- **Timer Updates**: Verified WebSocket still updates timers correctly
- **Broadcasting**: Verified updates are still broadcast to shared users
- **Timer Stopping**: Verified timer stopping still works correctly
- **Relationship Management**: Verified REST API handles relationships correctly

## Backward Compatibility

### API Compatibility
- **REST API**: No changes to existing endpoints
- **WebSocket API**: No breaking changes to message format
- **Client Code**: No changes required for existing clients

### Message Format
The `shareWith` field in WebSocket messages is no longer used for relationship management but is still accepted for backward compatibility.

## Deployment Notes

- **No breaking changes**: Existing clients continue to work
- **Gradual adoption**: No immediate action required
- **Monitoring**: Watch for any issues with timer sharing or updates
- **Performance**: Expect slightly faster WebSocket message processing
