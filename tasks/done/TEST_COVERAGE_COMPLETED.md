# Improve Test Coverage

## Task Information
- **Title**: Improve Test Coverage and WebSocket Testing
- **Created**: 2025-10-10
- **Status**: Active
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Assigned To**: Development Team

## Overview
This task focuses on building comprehensive test coverage for the Bubble Timer backend, with special emphasis on WebSocket functionality, DynamoDB operations, and API Gateway integration. The goal is to establish solid guardrails to prevent regressions and catch issues before deployment.

## Background
The previous development attempt revealed that many issues were not caught until deployment and testing with real devices. This indicates a significant gap in our testing strategy, particularly around WebSocket message handling, real-time updates, and integration between different AWS services.

## Objectives
- [ ] Establish comprehensive WebSocket testing framework
- [ ] Add integration tests for DynamoDB operations
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for timer sharing workflows
- [x] ~~Implement performance and load testing~~ *(moved to separate future task)*
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] Add error scenario testing for all failure modes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All WebSocket message types have comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] DynamoDB operations are tested with realistic data and error scenarios
- [ ] Timer sharing workflows work correctly in multi-user scenarios
- [x] ~~Performance tests validate system behavior under load~~ *(moved to separate future task)*
- [ ] Error handling is tested for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Tests can be run locally and in CI environment

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
No architectural changes required - this is purely a testing enhancement.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: WebSocket Testing Framework
- [ ] Create comprehensive WebSocket message testing utilities
- [ ] Add tests for all WebSocket message types (updateTimer, stopTimer)
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection management (connect, disconnect)
- [ ] Test message broadcasting to multiple connected users
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid messages and connection failures

#### Phase 2: DynamoDB Integration Testing
- [ ] Create realistic test data factories
- [ ] Test all DynamoDB operations with proper mocking
- [ ] Test error scenarios (conditional check failures, throttling, etc.)
- [ ] Test shared timer queries and relationships
- [ ] Test connection tracking and cleanup

#### Phase 3: End-to-End Workflow Testing
- [ ] Test complete timer lifecycle (create, update, share, stop)
- [ ] Test multi-user scenarios with timer sharing
- [ ] Test concurrent operations and race conditions
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Test API Gateway integration and response handling

*Note: Performance and Load Testing will be addressed in a separate future task.*

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and AWS service integration
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows and real-world scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Test system behavior under load and stress conditions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Jest testing framework (already in place)
- [ ] AWS SDK mocking capabilities
- [ ] Test data management utilities
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Complex WebSocket mocking | Medium | High | Use established patterns and utilities |
| DynamoDB test data complexity | Medium | Medium | Create comprehensive test data factories |
| Performance test environment | Low | Medium | Use local testing with realistic data volumes |
| Test maintenance overhead | Medium | Low | Follow established patterns and documentation |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality has test coverage
- [ ] New tests follow established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Tests can be run independently and in isolation
- [ ] Test coverage report shows 90%+ coverage for critical paths
- [x] ~~Performance tests validate acceptable response times~~ *(moved to separate future task)*
- [ ] Error scenarios are comprehensively tested

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on WebSocket testing as the highest priority
- Use realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios
- Ensure tests are fast and reliable for CI/CD pipeline
- Document testing patterns for future development
