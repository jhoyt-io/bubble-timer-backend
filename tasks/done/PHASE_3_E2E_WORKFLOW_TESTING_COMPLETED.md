- **Partial Failures**: Testing scenarios where some operations succeed and others fail

## Technical Approach

### **Workflow-Based Testing**
Instead of testing individual components, the E2E tests focus on complete user workflows:
- **User Stories**: Each test represents a complete user story
- **Multi-Step Scenarios**: Testing sequences of related operations
- **Real-World Usage**: Simulating actual user behavior patterns
- **End-to-End Validation**: Verifying complete data flows

### **Comprehensive Mocking Strategy**
```typescript
// Mock AWS SDK clients
jest.mock('@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb');
jest.mock('@aws-sdk/client-apigatewaymanagementapi');

// Mock aws-jwt-verify
jest.mock('aws-jwt-verify', () => ({
  CognitoJwtVerifier: {
    create: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
      verify: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
        'cognito:username': 'test-user'
      })
    })
  }
}));
```

### **Given/When/Then Pattern**
```typescript
describe('Given a complete timer sharing workflow', () => {
  describe('When User A creates and shares a timer with User B and User C', () => {
    test('Then the timer should be updated and broadcast to all shared users', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
