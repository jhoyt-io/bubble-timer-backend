# Task Management System

This directory contains the task management system for the Bubble Timer backend project, designed to track major work, implementation plans, and project progress.

## Directory Structure

```

├── README.md                    # This file
├── TASK_TEMPLATE.md            # Template for creating new tasks
├── active/                     # Currently active tasks
│   └── IMPROVE_TEST_COVERAGE.md # Current high-priority task
└── done/                       # Completed tasks and summaries
```

## Task Categories

### Active Tasks (`active/`)
Tasks that are currently being worked on or planned for immediate implementation.

**Current Active Tasks:**
- **[IMPROVE_TEST_COVERAGE.md](active/IMPROVE_TEST_COVERAGE.md)** - High-priority task to establish comprehensive test coverage, especially for WebSocket functionality

### Completed Tasks (`done/`)
Tasks that have been completed, including summaries of what was accomplished, decisions made, and lessons learned.

## Task Lifecycle

### 1. Task Creation
- Use `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point
- Fill in all required sections
- Set appropriate priority and effort estimates
- Add to `active/` directory

### 2. Task Execution
- Follow the implementation plan
- Update progress log regularly
- Document any deviations from the plan
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met

### 3. Task Completion
- Move task from `active/` to `done/`
- Complete the "Completion Summary" section
- Document lessons learned and outcomes
- Update related documentation if needed

## When to Create Tasks

### Create Tasks For:
- **Major features** that affect 50%+ of the codebase
- **Architectural changes** that impact multiple components
- **Infrastructure modifications** that require careful planning
- **Testing improvements** that establish new patterns
- **Security enhancements** that require comprehensive review

### Don't Create Tasks For:
- **Minor bug fixes** that can be handled in regular development
- **Documentation updates** that don't change architecture
- **Simple refactoring** that doesn't change interfaces
- **Routine maintenance** tasks

## Task Template Usage

### Required Sections
- **Task Information**: Title, status, priority, effort estimate
- **Overview**: Brief description of what the task accomplishes
- **Objectives**: Specific, measurable goals
- **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of when the task is complete
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach with phases
- **Testing Strategy**: How the changes will be tested
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements for completion

### Optional Sections
- **Risks and Mitigation**: Potential issues and how to address them
- **Dependencies**: What needs to be in place before starting
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical details and decisions
- **Related Documentation**: Links to relevant docs and issues

## Best Practices

### Task Planning
- **Be specific** about objectives and success criteria
- **Break down large tasks** into manageable phases
- **Estimate effort realistically** based on complexity
- **Identify dependencies** early to avoid blockers

### Task Execution
- **Follow incremental development** - small, testable changes
- **Update progress regularly** in the progress log
- **Document decisions** and rationale as you go
- **Test thoroughly** at each phase

### Task Completion
- **Verify all acceptance criteria** are met
- **Document outcomes** and any deviations from plan
- **Share lessons learned** for future reference
- **Update related documentation** if needed

## Current Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Improve Test Coverage** - Establish comprehensive testing framework
2. **WebSocket Testing** - Focus on real-time functionality testing
3. **Integration Testing** - Test AWS service interactions

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization** - Improve system performance
2. **Security Enhancements** - Strengthen authentication and authorization
3. **Monitoring Improvements** - Better observability and debugging

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation Updates** - Keep docs current with code
2. **Code Refactoring** - Improve code quality and maintainability
3. **Feature Extensions** - Add new capabilities

## Task Review Process

### Weekly Review
- Review all active tasks for progress
- Update priorities based on current needs
- Identify any blocked or stalled tasks
- Plan next week's focus areas

### Monthly Review
- Complete any finished tasks
- Archive completed tasks to `done/`
- Identify new tasks needed
- Review overall project progress

## Integration with Development

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches for task work
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Reference task files in commit messages
- Update task progress as work is completed

### Documentation Updates
- Update relevant docs when tasks are completed
- Add new patterns to extension guides
- Update quick reference for new commands
- Document any architectural changes

## Task Metrics

### Tracking Progress
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed on time
- **Effort Accuracy**: How well effort estimates match actual time
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, error rates, performance
- **Documentation Coverage**: How well changes are documented

### Continuous Improvement
- **Retrospectives**: Learn from completed tasks
- **Process Refinement**: Improve task management process
- **Template Updates**: Enhance task template based on experience
- **Best Practices**: Share successful patterns across team

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members
1. **Read this README** to understand the task system
2. **Review active tasks** to understand current priorities
3. **Check completed tasks** to learn from past work
4. **Use the template** when creating new tasks

### For Task Creation
1. **Copy TASK_TEMPLATE.md** to create a new task
2. **Fill in all required sections** thoroughly
3. **Get review** from team members if needed
4. **Add to active directory** when ready to start

### For Task Management
1. **Update progress regularly** as work is completed
2. **Document decisions** and rationale
3. **Move to done directory** when complete
4. **Update related documentation** as needed
