# Test Failure Handling

When working with test files:
- If tests are failing at the end of an attempt to satisfy a prompt, call this out clearly
- Do NOT celebrate completion or suggest continuing when tests are still failing
- Propose specific options for fixing the failing tests
- Focus on resolving test failures before proceeding with other work
- Suggest debugging steps, test isolation, or specific fixes for the failing tests
- Write tests that tell a story about the system behavior
- Use descriptive context in "Given" blocks
- Make "When" blocks describe the specific action being tested
- Use "Then" blocks to describe the expected outcome
- Avoid repeating information between test description and expect statements
- Focus on behavior and outcomes rather than implementation details
- Make tests readable enough to serve as documentation
