# Task Management

- Use the `tasks/` directory for tracking major work and implementation plans
- Create implementation plans in `tasks/active/` when explicitly requested by the user
- Create summary files in `tasks/done/` for major changes that affect 50%+ of the codebase or fundamental architectural approaches
- Use `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point for new tasks
- Do NOT create task files for every chat - only for significant work or when explicitly requested
- When completing major work, create a summary file in `tasks/done/` documenting the changes, decisions, and outcomes
