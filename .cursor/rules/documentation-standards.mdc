# Documentation Standards

When working with documentation files:
- Keep `docs/` directory updated with current architecture and patterns
- Document any new patterns or architectural decisions
- Maintain `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with common commands and debugging steps
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` when making significant architectural changes
- Document test patterns and strategies in `TESTING.md`
- Use clear, concise language in documentation
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
