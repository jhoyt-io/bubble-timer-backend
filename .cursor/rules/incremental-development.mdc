# Incremental Development

- ALWAYS follow the incremental development loop:
  1. Build and run tests to establish baseline before making changes
  2. Add a test that will fail until your new feature/change is complete (TDD approach)
  3. Make an incremental step toward the final solution
  4. Add relevant tests to cover what you've written
  5. Ensure all tests pass, including the initial acceptance tests
  6. Proceed with the next step toward the final solution
- NO big-bang changes: Every change should be small, testable, and verifiable
- Every step should be well-tested to guard against regressions
- If a change is large, break it into smaller, incremental steps that can be tested independently
