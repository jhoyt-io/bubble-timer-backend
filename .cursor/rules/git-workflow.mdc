# Git and Code Management

- NEVER commit code directly to main branch
- Stage changes for human review instead of committing
- Work on feature branches when appropriate and ask for merge reviews
- Use git to view history and understand context, but don't commit without explicit permission
- The human-AI devloop: Stage changes → Human review → Human commits/pushes
