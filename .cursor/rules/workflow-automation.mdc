# Workflow Automation

When asked to analyze the app or implement features:
1. Run tests to establish baseline: `npm run build:test`
2. Check current test coverage and status
3. Follow incremental development loop for any changes
4. Ensure all tests pass before proceeding
5. Document significant changes in appropriate files

When working on WebSocket functionality:
1. Review existing WebSocket tests first
2. Add comprehensive tests for new WebSocket features
3. Test both success and error scenarios
4. Verify DynamoDB interactions
5. Test API Gateway responses
