# Deployment Safety Rules

- NEVER run deployment commands (cdk deploy, npm run deploy, etc.)
- NEVER execute commands that could modify production infrastructure
- If infrastructure changes are needed, only suggest them or create the files, but don't deploy
- Always ask for explicit permission before any deployment-related actions
