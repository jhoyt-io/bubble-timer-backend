# Architecture Context

- ALWAYS read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` first for data flows and component responsibilities
- Reference `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for debugging commands and common patterns
- Check `docs/FEATURE_EXTENSION_PATTERNS.md` for guidance on extending core systems
- Use the documentation to understand WebSocket, API Gateway, and DynamoDB patterns before making changes
- Key architecture points: Lambda handlers â†’ DynamoDB operations, WebSocket connections, API Gateway responses
